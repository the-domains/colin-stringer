Hygge

As second winter holds out and desperation peaks for the sights, sounds and warmth of spring here in the north, I'm reminded of a Danish concept I was recently introduced to: [Hygge][0]. It's a concept about being snug and cozy and well, and more than that it's an attitude. It's about being present in our daily rituals, and enjoying the warmth and presence of others, the subtleties of the spaces that surround and connect us. And it's got me feeling more excited than ever to take advantage of that coziness that only winter can bring with a hot bevy over a warm fire with friends.

Watch my [video of my stunning friend Aja][1]. It's my attempt to capture hygge here in Sudbury.
